# Geopandas

This code uses Python libraries like pandas and geopandas to analyze and visualize data related to bird movements. It reads a dataset containing information about bird locations over time, including timestamps and geographical coordinates. After converting the data into a GeoDataFrame, it plots the bird locations on a map, where each bird's path, starting point (in green), and ending point (in blue) are displayed. The dataset is then grouped by bird identifier, creating a GeoDataFrame for the paths, starting points, and ending points. Finally, it produces a comprehensive map with country boundaries (in whitesmoke) and overlays the bird paths (in orange), starting points (in green), and ending points (in blue) for visual analysis of bird movements in the Americas.****
